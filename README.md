## This is a poetry dependency file that can be used in the rag project.

#### Added contents
1. My graphics card is 3090 and I used CUDA 11.8 version because it is stable in poetry.
2. I added some modules to enable the use of the Jupyter environment.
3. I used pdfplumber for pdf ocr, but you can use other modules as well.
